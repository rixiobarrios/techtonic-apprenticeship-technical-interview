        <li>Final interviews are being conducted virtually via Zoom and VS code. Instructions for setting up VS code are attached.
        Test your VS Code, speakers, laptop microphones and camera to ensure everything is working properly PRIOR to the
        interview. IF YOUR EQUIPMENT DOES NOT WORK the interview will conclude.</li>
        <li>Please plan for approximately 40 minutes - 1 hour for us to conduct the interview.</li>
        <li>n this interview you will virtually "meet" with some of our Techtonic team and be asked to demonstrate your technical
        understanding of the pre-work and challenges you completed. There will be some opportunity at the end of the interview
        to ask questions you may have about the curriculum, Academy or technology. Anything outside of that scope can be
        answered via email to apprenticeship@techtonic.com</li>
        <li>There a few others scheduled on this date and times are offered on a first-come / first-serve basis. Due to team
        schedules, we are unable to offer alternate interview times from those listed at this time.</li>
        <li>This call/session will be recorded for record-keeping, training and quality-assurance purposes.</li>
